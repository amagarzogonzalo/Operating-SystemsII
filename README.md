# Operating-SystemsII
The Deep Dive into Linux Operating System project is a comprehensive study and practical exploration of various facets of the Linux Operating System. It utilizes C programming language to unravel the intricacies of processes, pipes, sockets, and file systems.

The project thoroughly investigates Linux processes, providing insights into their creation, management, and termination. It explores synchronization techniques, signals, and scheduling policies, highlighting their roles in ensuring smooth and efficient system operations.

It delves into pipes, focusing on both named and unnamed variants. The project demonstrates their use in interprocess communication, providing an in-depth understanding of how data is transferred between processes.

The project also features an extensive study of sockets, particularly TCP and UDP. It illuminates the mechanics of network programming, illustrating the processes of data transmission over networks using these popular protocols.

Furthermore, the project delves into multiplexed I/O and file locking mechanisms, shedding light on how Linux manages multiple I/O points simultaneously and ensures controlled access to shared resources.

The Deep Dive into Linux Operating System project stands as an extensive exploration of Linux's functionalities. Through the examination of various system and networking aspects, it provides a holistic understanding of the operating system's operations, contributing to a more effective and informed use of Linux for system-level programming.
